## Cause

A `Verify()` or `VerifyAll()` of an `Mock<T>` instance has not been called in the *Assert* phase
of an unit test.

## Rule description

When instantiating a `Mock<T>` in the *Arrange* phase of an unit test, `Verify()` or `VerifyAll()` method
should be called in the *Assert* phase to check the setup methods has been called.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void GetCustomer_ShouldCallRepository()
{
	// Arrange
	var smtpService = new Mock<ISmtpService>();
	smtpService.Setup(s => s.SendMail("sender@domain.com", "Gilles"));

	var service = new CustomerService(repository.Object);

	// Act
	service.SendMail("Gilles");

	// Assert
	smtpService.VerifyAll();	// The VerifyAll() will check that the mocked ISmtpService.SendMail() has been called.
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, call the `Verify()` or `VerifyAll()` in the *Assert* phase
on the `Mock<T>` instances created during the *Arrange* phase.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Normally all setup methods must be call.
