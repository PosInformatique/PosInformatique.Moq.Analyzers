## Cause

A Mock<T> instance has been created with the `Loose` behavior instead of `Strict`.

## Rule description

When instantiating a `Mock<T>` instance, the `MockBehavior` of the `Mock` instance should be defined to `Strict`.

By default, [Moq](https://github.com/devlooped/moq) build instances of mocked instance which have a `Loose` behavior for non-setup methods.

For example with the following code:
```csharp
public interface IRepository
{
    int GetData();
}

public class Service
{
	private readonly IRepository repository;

    public Service(IRepository repository)
	{
		this.repository = repository;
	}

	public int GetDataFromRepository()
	{
		return this.repository.GetData();
	}
}
```

If a `Mock<T>` instance of `IRepository` is created with the `Loose` behavior (default behavior of [Moq](https://github.com/devlooped/moq)) and
the `GetData()` method has not been setup, the default `int` value (`0`) will be returned.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void GetDataFromRepository()
{
	// Arrange
	var repository = new Mock<ISmtpService>();		// Default behavior (Loose)

	//  /!\ No methods on the ISmtpService has been setup !
	
	var service = new CustomerService(repository.Object);

	// Act
	var result = service.GetDataFromRepository();	// "result" will be defined to 0.
}
```

To fix the violation of this rule for the previous example,
set the `MockBehavior` to `Strict` in the constructor of the `Mock<T>` class.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void GetDataFromRepository()
{
	// Arrange
	var repository = new Mock<ISmtpService>(MockBehavior.Strict);		// Strict behavior (Loose)

	//  /!\ No methods on the ISmtpService has been setup !
	
	var service = new CustomerService(repository.Object);

	// Act
	var result = service.GetDataFromRepository();	// A "MoqException" will be raised to indicate that the GetData() method has not been setup !
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, set the `MockBehavior` to `Strict` in the constructor of the `Mock<T>` class.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Normally all methods called on a mocked instance must be setup.
